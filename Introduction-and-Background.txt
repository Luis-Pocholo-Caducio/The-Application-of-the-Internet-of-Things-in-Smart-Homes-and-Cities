The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the way we live and work. In 2022, the market for the IoT is expected to grow 18% to 14.4 billion active connections. By 2025, there will be about 27 billion connected IoT devices (Hasan, 2022; “What’s Next for the Internet of Things? | IMI, “ n.d.). The Internet of Things, as a concept, was not officially named until 1999, when computer scientist Kevin Ashton coined the term. Ashton proposed putting radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips on products to track them through a supply chain. One of the first examples of an IoT was a Coca-Cola machine from the early 1980s located￼￼. Local programmers would connect through the Internet to the machine and check if there was a drink available and cold before going to buy one (Dlewis, 2022; Foote, 2023). Paper by Hussein (2019) states that it is crucial to recognize the potential domains for IoT’s application and the research challenges associated with them. Hussein also states that it is a significant research topic for studies in various related fields such as information technology and computer science. This is why the group wants to know the benefits and threats of IoT. The members also want to support their position that it is good technology by presenting ways to mitigate those risks. 

The study mainly aims to study the concept of IoT in smart homes and cities. Specifically, the study aims to determine its benefits and disadvantages to smart homes and cities. The findings of this study will provide the public recommendations on mitigating those disadvantages and using IoT to its full potential. 

The scope of the topic involves the components of IoT architecture for smart cities, homes, and environments. The components included are sensors, networks, gateways, cloud infrastructure, applications, and security measures. The study will include an overview of the components and associated roles. Concerns regarding IoT that are not within the scope will not be covered.
