It can be concluded that IoT is applied in smart homes and cities. Because of the expected growth of IoT and its various projects specifically to smart city as well as smart homes, the study is significant and should be the focus of researchers. The main objective of the study is to provide an idea on how it is applied and what are the components of IoT architecture involved.  This study has found that the applications the technology has in smart cities are in traffic management, public safety, urban sustainability and in smart homes, security and protection, control and monitoring, sustainability, home routine and entertainment. Sensors were the component redundantly stated because they are repeatedly used from monitoring traffic flow to monitoring movement in the bathroom. The scope of this study may be expanded to the use cases of IoT architecture, e.g., healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture to show how these networks create value and where it is most useful (Team Celona, 2022). 

The study also aims to determine IoTâ€™s benefits and disadvantages. Some of the advantages determined were enhanced efficiency, improved safety and security, energy conservation, better quality of life, sustainability, and benefits to the economy. The drawbacks are that data collected by IoT devices are sensitive and susceptible to hackers. The real-world benefit of IoT is a threat to the cybersecurity and data privacy of users. The challenge is to balance both the security and privacy of users in the real world and their cybersecurity and data privacy. This is necessary to guarantee the appropriate and long-term use of IoT technologies.
